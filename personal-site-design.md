What is you site's primary purpose?

For people to get in contact with me if they are interested in web development or would like to hear more about web development. Also for those that are interested to read my blogs.


Who is your target audience?

The general public & more specifically the tech industry.


How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I would like a nice clean website that's easy to understand by having displaying a good user sxperience. The user will be able to see my contact details, read a little bit more about me & also read my blogs that I post. I would like the user to come away from my website thinking that it was a very clear, good looking website & that they would happily return to stay up to date with my blog posts.


How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

I will look at other examples of websites with good user experience & try to learn and model my website off those. The Article '7 rules for creating gorgeous UI' is an interesting read, which I will apply to my user experience for my website. I will also use other tools/software packages such as skeleton, Adobe InDesign etc which will help aid my websites user experience.
