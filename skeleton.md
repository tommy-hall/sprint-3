What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works?

When I resize the screen to less thatn 550px my text resizes, however by images do not.

This is due to my website not currently being a responsive site, which is: one which makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.

Responsive Design have to be 1. Flexible which means it adjusts for the size of the screen and 2. Adjustable which means the contents on the page can change and move around depending on the size of screen -
e.g. @media only screen and (min-width:40em)

This is particularly important nowadays, because of the large number of internet-accessible devices available and the wide variation of their screen sizes. What looks good on a desktop computer will not look good on a mobile device without adjusting the formatting. The site must also work on different devices, different browsers & different operating systems.
